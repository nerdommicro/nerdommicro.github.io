                  About Me
              </strong>
          </h1>
          I have a strong passion for web and software development and you can see this with my 
          design portfolio. I started out creating basic HTML profiles for my friends and family.
          Then I moved up to selling products online for my own business and needed 
          to use HTML code for the advertising. And now I am an experienced programmer and web designer. <br />
          I taught myself programming years ago and took over 100 courses to get to where I am today. And I am always learning. <br />
          (And i am still taking courses). As for my attitude, I am very laid back and I work extremely well with others. That is one of my best qualities. 
          I also take the time and enjoy mentoring others who need help.<br /><br />
          My interests out of coding are watching baseball (Lets Go Mets!), managing my business, and running a blog site.
